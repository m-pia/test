# Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a collection of demos for various web technologies, including TensorFlow.js, ROS, React, and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience for developers interested in these technologies.

## Implemented Features

### Design & Style
- Modern, dark theme using Tailwind CSS.
- Responsive layout for mobile and web.
- Interactive cards for demo selection.
- Consistent header and navigation.

### TensorFlow.js Demos
- **Simple Model:** Demonstrates a simple linear regression model running in the browser.
- **Image Classification:** Classifies images using the `MobileNet` model.
- **Object Detection:** Detects objects in an image using the `COCO-SSD` model.
- **Face Detection:** Detects facial landmarks using the `FaceMesh` model.
- **Toxicity Classification:** Classifies the toxicity of a sentence using the `Toxicity` model.
- **Question & Answer:** Answers questions based on a context using the `MobileBERT` model.
- **Speech Command Recognition:** Recognizes simple speech commands.

### ROS Demos
- **Topic Viewer:** Shows how to view ROS topics in real-time.

### React Demos
- **useOptimistic Hook:** An example of using the `useOptimistic` hook from React 19.

### Tailwind CSS Demos
- **JIT Engine:** A demonstration of the new JIT engine in Tailwind CSS v4.

## Current Plan: Expand ROS Demos

The current plan is to expand the ROS demos to cover a wider range of ROS concepts and to integrate 2D and 3D visualization libraries.

### Steps
1.  **Update Demo List:** Add the new demos to the `ROS` category page.
2.  **Service Caller:** Create a demo to call ROS services.
3.  **Parameter Viewer:** Create a demo to view and manage ROS parameters.
4.  **Action Caller:** Create a demo to interact with ROS actions.
5.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Create a demo for dynamic reconfiguration of ROS nodes.
6.  **2D View:** Create a demo using `ros2djs` to display 2D visualizations, such as maps.
7.  **3D View:** Create a demo using `ros3djs` to display 3D visualizations, such as robot models and point clouds.
8.  **Install Libraries:** Install `ros2djs` and `ros3djs`.
